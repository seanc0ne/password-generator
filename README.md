# Password Generator

Welcome to the README for my third project as a student of Coding Boot Camp at UCLA Extension: The password generator.

## Description

My third project is to flex my JavaScript muscle by developing a password generator. The password generator is supposed to provide the user with a completely random password. The user is prompted regarding the length of the password and if they would like it to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols and integers.
